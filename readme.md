FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

auth, set username, set nickname, join channel, send/receive private messages
user privileges (operator/regular)
commands (operator): kick, invite, topic(change or view)
mode: (i: invite only, t: change topic permission, k: set/change/remove channel passowrd, o: give/take privilege, l: channel user limit)
mode i (yes/no, 1/0), optionnal channel name? or affects current channel
mode t : same(yes/no) same(arg or current)
mode k : newpassword for set, empty for remove OR just "mode k" and then prompt user to enter password and then confirm
mode o : user_to_change, (yes/no)
mode l : n to set limit, empty to remove


each channel has:
	- list of users
	- invite only mode
	- topic can only be changed by operator mode
	- a password (can be empty)
	- a limit (can be empty)

each user has:
	- a username
	- a nickname

create channel???
where to keep track of privilege? each user has a list of channel he is operator in? or each channel has a list of user that are operators in it?
what happens if a user leaves a channel? keep track of privilege or lose it?
who can become operator? who can create a new channel? delete channel? channel-wide privilege vs server-wide privilege

each channel keeps track of active users connected, echo all received lines to all users in that channel


3 classes: server, channel, user (??)

handle encryption, password safety?
handle internet connection or just local on 1 machine?
difference between some client and a bare terminal doing 'nc'?

- ft_split received line
- if first word starts with '/' then process command
- otherwise just send line to channel

use dynamic arrays, make our own ft_realloc in cpp?



focus:

server has an array of channels and an array of clients
test adding and removing channels
test connecting and disconnecting clients
server terminal reads its stdin for debug requests

lookup channel and clients?
